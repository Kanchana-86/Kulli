      <h2>What is "Fishing the Feed"?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Fishing the Feed</strong> is an interactive website that exposes the environmental and social impacts of the aquaculture industry's reliance on wild-caught fish for feed.

        The website aims to raise awareness and encourage action towards more sustainable aquaculture practices.
